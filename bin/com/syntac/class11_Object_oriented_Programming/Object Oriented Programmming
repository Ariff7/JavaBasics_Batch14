What is an Object?
   -Everything around us is an object (Ex.Keyboard, computer, car)
   -Objects can be defined based on how they look and how they behave
  
  -Objects in computer programming are very similar. (They have state (--Which helps us define
  how that object looks like--) and behaviors(--How it functions--)

What is a class?:
   - Class is a blueprint/design/template from which we create the objects.

Object oriented programming:
   - a way of writing programs
   
   Why should we learn OOP?
     1.) It simplifies the development of large programs
     2.) It helps us maintain and modify the existing code
     3.) It helps us write more secure codes
     4.) It helps us avoid duplicate code/
     
  What is the syntax?
  
   Main pillars of OOP
    
      1.) Classes and objects
             Classes- a template/blueprint from which we create the objects
             Objects- similar to objects we have in real life
                      -have states that defines how the object looks like. We define the states with 
                      the help of Attributes/properties/fields inside a class
                      -
      2.) Inheritance
      3.) Polymorphism
      4.) Abstraction
      5.) Encapsulation
